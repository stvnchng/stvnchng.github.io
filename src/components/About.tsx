              Hi, I&apos;m Steven. I specialize in crafting great user
              experiences. I am currently an engineer at EnergyBot, where I work
              across both the UI and backend to deliver a seamless experience
              for our residential customers.

              Outside of work, I enjoy building interactive media such as games
              or websites such as this one.
